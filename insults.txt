##name## Whenever we hang out, I remember that God really does have a sense of humor.
##name## It’s kind of hilarious watching you try to fit your entire vocabulary into one sentence.
##name## Please just tell me you don’t plan to home-school your kids.
##name## You always bring me so much joy—as soon as you leave the room.
##name## I was hoping for a battle of wits but it would be wrong to attack someone who’s totally unarmed.
